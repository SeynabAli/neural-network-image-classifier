# neural-network-image-classifier
##Project overview:

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The model uses multi-scale convolutions (1×1, 3×3, 5×5), an attention mechanism, and residual connections to improve performance.
Through careful hyperparameter tuning, regularisation, and data augmentation, the model achieved a test accuracy of 89.13%.
